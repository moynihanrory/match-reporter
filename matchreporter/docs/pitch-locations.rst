Pitch Layout
============
This is the pitch layout used.

.. parsed-literal::
                                       goal
                                1       2       3
                                left    middle  right
                                0-30    30-70   70-100
 a	Short	        0-16	1A	2A	3A
 b	Middle	        16-35	1B	2B	3B
 c	Long	        35-65	1C	2C	3C
 d	Very long       65-85	1D	2D	3D
 e	Very very long	85-100	1E	2E	3E
                                       goal

Note that the pitch layout above is from 0-100. This does not represent yardage of a pitch but the percentage distance e.g. 50 is 50% length/width of pitch.
